# Book Store Assessment

You have a friend that deals in valuable books She has asked if you would create an app that keeps track of her 20 most valuable books. Each book stored needs to have the book title, author, publisher, isbn (double), and estimated value. She will need a simple GUI that will let her add books and delete books from the app. She will need to be able to view her entire collection of her most valuable books and scroll through them. 

Your program should have a constructor that initializes the five instance variables. Provide a mutator method (setter) and accessor method (getter) for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named GetBookInfo that returns the description of the book as a string (the description should include all the information about the book). You should use Me keyword in member methods and constructor(s). Use Test Driven Design to demonstrate your applicationâ€™s capabilities.  

This app needs to be a simulation, so you do not need to use permanent storage (an array is fine).
